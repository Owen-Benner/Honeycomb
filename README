Choice selection algorithm:
	If last correct
		Correct choice = goal dir, other choice = goal dir + beta
		If other choice is off edge
			Try replacing beta with 60 deg
			Try inverting beta
			Reuse beta
		If other choice = last hex
			Force choice
			Reuse beta?
	If last incorrect
		If goal dir exactly = last hex
			Force choice 60 deg off in last correct direction
		Correct choice = goal dir
			other choice = goal dir +/- 60
			Select other choice closest to goal dir
		If correct choice = last hex
			both choices +/- 60
			choose side closer to goal dir
		If other choice = last hex
			mirror over correct choice
		If other choice = off edge
			Force choice
