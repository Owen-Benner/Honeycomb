Terms:
	Choice—Option presented to player
	Action—Decision made by player
	Alpha—Angle from action direction to direction to goal

Choice selection algorithm:
	After correct choice
		For positive beta, round correct choice to right of goal
			for negative beta, left of goal
			Angle from goal to incorrect choice as large as
			...possible
		If incorrect choice leads off map or to prev hex, flip
		...both choices across player-goal axis
			Beta index advances
			If choice flipped and still bad, try next beta
			If new beta doesn't work, force correct choice
	Following incorrect choice
		Always 60 deg between choices
		Alternate left vs right within a trial
			Start left on odd trials, right on even
		If incorrect choice leads off map or to prev hex, flip
		...both choices across player-goal axis
			If choice flipped and still bad, force choice
			Advance left/right continuity an extra step
			...(different from after correct)
		Following a 180 degree incorrect choice, do not place the
		...correct option on the previous hex
	When alpha == 0 following 180 degree incorrect choice, offer
	...player a 60 degree choice, not including the hex in the
	...direction of the goal, with both options on the side
	...corresponding to the left/right after incorrect continuity.
		Advance left/right after incorrect continuity.
	If a forced choice leads onto the goal, move to next beta and try
	...again
